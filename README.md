# Travler_Rotor
Multi-axis antenna rotor using Winegard "Trav'ler" satellite dish
(See https://youtu.be/X1hnReHepFI for example of use). 

This code is currently a work in progress and will have some major updates soon (hopefully). 

Currently it "sort of" works, but should be considered only a proof-of-concept. 

Known problems include:
- Delay / rate limiting commands while dish is moving
- Meridian flip handling

Minor improvements on the to-do list:
- Init script to kill initial TV satellite search
- General cleanup / documentation
- Better README file (this document)
- Better explanation / pinout of cables (for now, see https://github.com/saveitforparts/Carryout-Radio-Telescope)

  Again, this is VERY unfinished code and should not be considered ready for use.
  Using this code could damage your dish, antenna feed, motors, wiring, etc!
  Other users have reportedly bricked or otherwise damaged the controller board
  or the connection between IDU and ODU when using similar code. User Beware!
